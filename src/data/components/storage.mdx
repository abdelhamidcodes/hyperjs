title: Save to Local Storage
group: storage

Saving to local storage is a great way to maintain user choice for features such as:

- Dark mode
- Grid/list layout

Thankfully, there's an [Alpine JS plugin](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/persist) that adds this functionality with an easy to use magic method. All it requires you to do is wrap you data within `x-data` in a `$persist` method, something like this:

```html
x-data="{ darkMode: $persist(false), collectionLayout: $persist('grid') }"
```

On initial load these values will be saved into local storage and then updated when the values are changed.
